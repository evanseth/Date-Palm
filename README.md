### Introduction
Parts of the Sheikh Zayed Mosque, completed in Abu Dhabi in 2007, look a lot like the pyramid of Sahure, completed in lower Egypt in the 25th century BC. While they’re separated by 45 centuries, thousands of miles, and differing cosmologies, date palms feature as prominently in ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian imagery as they do in peninsular Arabic cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The historical longevity of the date palm (_Phoenix dactylifera_) as a symbol is a testament not only to the species’ continued horticultural use, but to its adaptability as a vessel for cultural-identity making—  since the earliest societies in Mesopotamia, the date palm has appeared in literary, pictorial, political, and religious documentation. Like its namesake the phoenix, the date palm has, throughout recorded history, made and remade itself— sometimes a symbol for life and fertility, other times a symbol for victory, wealth, and prosperity. While the recorded uses of the Phoenix dactylifera are many, ranging from the date’s value as a durable and nutrient rich foodstuff to the palm frond’s uses in construction and Christian ritual to the potential fertility enhancing components of date palm pollen, the date palm itself is more than a useful plant; it is a collection of symbols that traverse human history.

### The Roots of the Date Palm 
There are over 13 different species of Phoenix (palm) trees and 400+ variations of Phoenix dactylifera, the “true” date palm tree, denoted as “true” because of its production of large fruits (typically Medjool dates) used for commercial fruit production. The native distribution of date palms is the Fertile Crescent of ancient Mesopotamia, also known as modern day Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Israel.[^ref1] Date palms can range in height from 3 ft to 85 ft and provide a variety of uses outside of producing dates. Their wood and leaves can be utilized for construction purposes while their bark can be used to produce fabric and cordage. Their sap is also a valuable ingredient for palm wine known as the “Elixer of Life.” Identifying characteristics of the date palm include their feather leaves, diamond-shaped leaf scars on the trunks and their dioecious nature.[^ref2] The <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="23,2208,673,1274">feather leaves</span> are a critical morphological trait of the date palm because they are pinnately divided, giving the impression the leaves are shredded, but are actually multiple leaf segments that form a single leaf. Additionally, their <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1355,2875,541,1024">diamond-shaped leaf scars</span> are evidence of their inability to “self-clean” and are instead a result of dead leaves staying attached to the trunk for numerous years, giving these trees the ability to be fire-resistant. Finally, the date palms are dioecious, meaning they have male and female trees that form separate flowers and fruits. <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1593,1883,541,1024">Dates</span> are produced primarily from female date palm trees and can range from ¼ inches to 2 inches long (typically the length of Medjool dates).

However, the date palm’s unique morphology that distinguishes it from the rest of the Phoenix genus is a result of its highly successful rooting system in such an arid climate. Date palms grow via fibrous roots through the development of pneumatophores (PN), a specialized root capable of growing up to five meters below ground and utilizing fiber cells around the cortex as a means of providing mechanical support to the roots and ensuring water retention. In addition, the date palm germinates via the remote-tubular method, in which “the primary leaf emerges then through an opening from the cotyledonary petiole. The tip of the cotyledonary petiole (CP) produces the root tip of the future seedling (DS). This structure grows in the soil keeping the developing embryo and the young seedling protected from the heat and dryness at the soil surface while allowing the roots to reach deeper soils.” [^ref3]

### Date Palm Oases
The date palm was first cultivated in oases, groundwater-fed areas of settlement and agriculture within arid environments. In Northern Africa and the Arabian peninsula, oases served as both rest stops along desert journeys and as sites of agroforestry. As seen in the figure,[^ref4] traditional oases feature a multi-tiered system of plant cultivation, in which date palms form a canopy that shields smaller fruit trees, like apricots, figs, and olives, from direct sunlight. These smaller trees in turn shield the oasis floor, where vegetables are grown and animals are raised. The date palms, through their wind reduction, increased shade, and evapotranspiration, help form a microclimate conducive to prolific plant cultivation in an extreme environment.[^ref5]

### Seeds of Society (VISUALIZATION → geographic timeline of spread of date palms & civilizations)
From the beginnings of early Mesopotamian civilizations to powerful kingdoms and empires throughout the Middle East and North Africa, humans relied on the date palm as a consistent source of nutrients and material. The wild date palm has been around for about five hundred million years starting in the mountains of Oman, but only started overlapping with human civilizations in the Mesolithic period, about twenty-five thousand years ago. [^ref6] At that time, paleolithic foragers were eating the seeds of spontaneous date palms in the Nefud desert. It wasn’t until the end of the Stone Age between 7000 and 5000 BCE when civilizations in southern Mesopotamia began to grow the plant as a crop using oasis agriculture and cultivation practices. Paleobotanical evidence suggests date palms were present in Pre-Dynastic Egypt, but not cultivated until around 1500 BCE as corroborated by emergence of palm motifs in New Dynasty era iconography and documentation. [^ref7] 

(Visualization: Tree of Life/cultivation tablet) A relationship between the date palm and human cultures quickly formed as the plant helped support the societies by providing fruit, seeds, leaves, fibers(hyperlink: https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/masad/hgFlcGtOeQltgw) , and wood. In return, by the third millennium BCE, mesopotamian inhabitants began cultivating and proliferating the date palm in their agriculture, materials, decoration, religion, and symbolism. The date was a reliable supply of food that could be stored and transported easily. People prized the date’s sweetness and the wine made from its inner syrup, while the stalk could be used for structural support, wood, and fiber, and leaves for roofing and weaving. Visualization: palm tree baskets & roofing]. The tree granted such life-sustaining provisions, early civilizations elevated and embedded its presence and image into their respective political, religious, and visual cultures.

The date palm’s ease of cultivation as a multi-purpose crop is a testament to its evolutionary ability to have such fertile pollen despite the environmental hardships. Being drought tolerant as well as salinity tolerant [^ref8] were well-integrated for the purposes of economic and religious uses in the Middle East. Moreover, the date palm’s ability to not only grow successfully but to propagate itself just as successfully was what solidified its legacy in the Middle East and allowed it’s mythology to be rooted in scientific truth. Emphasizing the incomparable value of the date palm pollen, as it was capable of producing viable date palm trees that yielded enough dates to sustain the diets of Middle Eastern civilizations, Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy (1755-1809) wrote,

_"The most dreadful famine would have desolated these unhappy countries, if the persians had not taken the precaution to keep in reserve the pollen of the antherae, and to use it for fecundating the female individuals. This observation preserves its fecundating property for a long time. It seems they kept it eighteen years without its having lost this virtue."_ [^ref9]

In these early civilizations of the Near East, the date palm sustained communities, first through nutrition and material, then through agriculture and economics. Governments harnessed the economic value of date palms through oasis cultivation. Date palms grew in hubs of political power such as Uruk, Babylon, Assyria, and Nineveh and appear in a range of laws, religion, and aesthetics from these geographies. Paragraph sixty of Hammurabi’s code in 1728 BCE "If any one give over a field to a gardener, for him to plant it as a garden, if he work at it, and care for it for four years, in the fifth year the owner and the gardener shall divide it, the owner taking his part in charge" refers to planting palms and suggests the relevancy of and practical application of its cultivation in early government documents.[^ref10] Its presence in the built environments illustrates its ubiquity not only in the natural and agricultural landscape, but also in the collective consciousness and imagination throughout its native lands. Egyptian kings had them painted into their homes and tombs. Two segments of the remnants of the Ishtar Gate are rows of palms.

###Upholding Foundations
Just as the Phoenix dactylifera’s agricultural and economic power materializes government documentation and architecture, early Mesopotamian religions also adopted the palm and its fruits into their pantheons as Gods of fertility and life, most notably goddesses Ishtar and Astarte. Cults of devotion associated the palm with the Tree of Life and incorporated it into their god figures, the leaves jutting out at the shoulders, and later conventionalized to feathers.[^ref11] This tree and its life-bearing properties sustained a presence in the region’s spirituality even as civilizations rose and fell and their religions evolved, adapting new meanings with each new belief system.

The date palm first appears in the book of Genesis as the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden, whose suggested location is around eastern Eridu, well within the region where the trees were cultivated. The tree subsequently appears in the Old Testament as Deborah’s shade in Judges, as building decorations in I Kings, II Chronicles, and I Maccabees, and throughout Moses’ exodus from Egypt to the Holy Land of Judea. In fact, the expression "the land of milk and honey," which appears twenty times in the Hebrew Bible to describe Israel, likely refers to the sugary "honey" produced by the dried date. Many early figures in the Abrahamic religions feasted upon this honey, most notably John the Baptist— a "voice of one crying in the wilderness" (John 1:23 KJV) of the Judaean Desert who fed on "locusts and wild honey" (Mark 1:6 KJV) before reaching and baptizing Jesus Christ. It is most iconic in the New Testament as Christ enters Jerusalem on an ass while crowd members “took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him” (John 12:13 KJV).Its leaves become a symbol of triumph and martyrdom in Christian visual convention and still proliferates every spring in parishes across the globe to celebrate Palm Sunday. 

Ancient Judaism regarded date palms as “the trademarks of valleys,” and its early writings discuss which types of dates “were acceptable for offering and prayer,” preferring those from the valleys over the mountains.[^ref12] The book of Leviticus directs its reader to take “branches of the palm trees… and … rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days” (Leviticus 23:40). This verse is the textual foundation for using lulav or leaves to thatch booths during Sukkot, or the Feast of the Tabernacle, a holiday each autumn, the same season as date harvest.

The date palm appears twenty-two times in the Quron and was celebrated for being found “only in islamic countries.” Mohammad called the tree the Paternal Aunt and considered it a “blessed tree,” their holy value having come from the same soil as Adam in Eden. Thirteenth century naturalist and cosmographer al-Qazwīnī documented the date palm in his Creations of the World and quotes the Prophet comparing the qualities of the tree to humans:"the date palm resembles man: it is tall and upright, it is female and male. He that cuts off the head of the date palm shall die; he that wounds its heart shall himself wither. If its offshoots are cut away, no others will come forth in their place. So, too hands of a man do not grow again if they are cut off. The date palm is covered with fibres like human hair. Is not Man then just like the date palm?!" [^ref13] [^ref14]

The architects and craftsmen of early mosques, synagogues, and churches incorporated the date palms and its meanings into the visual landscape of their respective spaces.Visualization: Mosque & Synagogue date palm] Because plants and trees were not considered idolatry, they could be included in the ornamentation of Muslum and Jewish spaces. As seen in the visualization, the date palm was rendered fairly realistically for its mosaic medium: the image communicates the texture of its scarred-bark, crown of its leaves, and volume of the trees’ fruit. Its presence in the sacred space communicates a sense of place, nature, and its symbols of fertility, prosperity, and fecundity, in line with Jewish and Muslim considerations of the plant.


###Classical Considerations
As the hubs of dominating civilizations moved westward from Mesopotamia to the Mediterranean first by the Phoenicians, and later by Greeks and Romans, the Date Palm traveled alongside. Gods, words, and images associated with the Date Palm carried on into the imagination of classical civilizations; its consideration mutating in each new space it inhabited, though the actual plant was cultivated almost exclusively for ornamental and non-functional use.

Greek scholars and politicians were well aware of the Palm date and its edible, medicinal, and polemic capacities. Dioscoredes, in his De Materia Medica, highlights the “Phoinix” as an Egyptian tree that bears “sour and astringent” fruit and whose parts have a number of healing effects for various discharges, gastric aches, and hemorrages.[^ref15] It is likely that the palm tree… in Egypt” he writes about is the North African variety of Phoenix Dac. as that is the type that was geographically closer to Greek territories and more accessible/known by his readers. As Dioscoredes notes, the date fruit from Egyptian palm trees was not that good to eat, nor could it keep as long as the dates from the Jordan Valley. Palm trees couldn’t thrive on a large scale in the centers of their respective empires, thus writers were aware of the tree both as an herbal remedy and a luxury import item.

The Phoenix dactylifera cameos in Greek lore associated with the god Apollo, as his mother “cast her arm around a palm tree”  while giving birth to him and Artemis on the Isle of Delos. Homer underscores this connection between Apollo, the tree, the place of Delos, and fertility in the Odyssey, as Ulysses describes being in Delos: “at the altar of Apollo, the fresh shoot of a palm coming up.” [^ref16] The palm becomes associated with the god and this island landscape, though it was previously not known for its palm tree population. Some of antiquity’s most notable scholars, Theophrastes, Cicero, and Pliny mention the tree as the Delian palm, shifting the plant's associations of place from the Middle East to this Greek isle and its god. Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, also has connections to the Date Palm; she holds a palm frond in hand in her many physical representations. Her name has the same root word nik- and the meaning of victory. Similarly, Nikolaos is a compound of the words victory and people, resembling the Hebrew name Nicolas that carries the same meaning.

The tree, primarily its symbolism and representation, became intertwined with the visual and political culture of the Roman Empire. The Roman goddess of victory, Victoria, carries a palm frond like Nike and was adopted into Roman culture of winning, be it in chariot races, gladiator fights, or battles, holding a palm leaf in celebratory processions or images thereof.

The image of the entire date palm tree as a Roman polemic tool proliferated in the first century C.E. after the Roman armies conquered Jerusalem and the lands of Judaea. Its image was a symbol for both Romans and Judeans, being struck on decorative and circulating coins conventionally including the whole tree with seven frond leaves (a potential reference to a menora) and two date clusters on one side and an emperor's bust on the reverse. During two different Jewish revolts against the Romans in the first century, jewish mints produced coins with palms, but no emperor to reclaim its image and place-based sentiment.[^ref17] Its representation carried shared and disparate meanings to its Roman producers and Judaean holders. For the Jews, it communicated a sense of place for the Judaean area as well as themes of fecundity and prosperity. For the Romans, the palm tree recalls their Goddess Victoria of victory and implies the empires’ dominance over the native land from which the most sought after dates from palms grow. Additionally, this Judaean plant being on a Roman coin emphasized Rome’s economic control over its new territory, as well as nods to the economic value of the date palm, itself.

### The Lasting Fruits: The Palm Tree’s Legacy in the Western Imagination
As the Roman Empire waned and the Christian population expanded, the date palm once again survived a transition into a new culture with unique visual conventions derived from its predecessors. Early Christians conflated pagan Roman imagery with their own meaning, using the palm frond to signify victory over death and martyrdom. A mosaic of a winged angel holds a laurel wreath and a palm frond in a space with two containers set in the floor of the Basilica of Aquileia, built right after Constantine's 313 AD Edict of Milan. The figure and her accessories resemble goddesses Victoria and Nike, once again adopting Roman pagan and secular symbols in a sacred space created just as the Empire began tolerating Christianity.

The Tree of Life mosaic in the apse of the Basilica of San Clemente Rome exemplifies the Christian co-option and transformation of the date palm into its own specific meaning well into the twelfth century. Saint Clement, for whom this church was named, wrote of the phoenix bird as a symbol of rebirth and migration between Arabia and Egypt, evoking Christ as a phoenix in his first epistle. Saint Clement and the craftsmen of this apse’s mosaic strung together more than a millennia of the palm tree’s various meanings and names into one visual program: the phoenix bird, the tree as Phoenix, death, rebirth, geography, and prosperity. [^ref18] There are no clusters of dates hanging from the palm leaves. Instead, Christ hangs on a crucifix resting on/emerging from the crown of the tree as if born from the nest of a phoenix. His death signifies an ultimate sacrifice, the defeat of evil, and the gift of life for his followers. Thus Christ is victorious like Nike and Victoria, reborn like a phoenix, and life-giving like the tree and its fruit. Along with white for purity, the frond of the palm became a symbol for martyrs in Early Christianity and ingrained itself into Western European visual convention.

As Christian iconography standardized in early Renaissance Europe, the date palm characterized Judean geography and martyrdom. Its image evoked biblical geographies of Egypt, Judea, Jericho, Jerusalem, and the Jordan Valley depending on accompanying figures and context.[^ref19] Morphologically, artists begin to exclude the bunches of date palms from their renderings, a possible explanation being artists who had seen date palms in Europe likely would not have seen their dates as they cannot produce fruit in Mediterranean climates. Iconographically, this exclusion of the date in the palm’s repeated representation suggests the tree has become a type/symbol whose meaning is more referential to objects around the tree than related to the tree itself.

Visualization: map of christian scenes & biblical geography w date palm]Depictions of Date Palm tree evoke geographies in the biblical images of Moses’s return to Canaan, Christ’s Entry into Jerusalem, and the Flight into Egypt, though rarely the expulsion from Eden. Artists repeated and proliferated these scenes in paintings, frescos, architectural features, and prints. Its leaves appear in images of martyrs, a remnant of the Roman symbol of victory and Christ’s association with sacrifice and the date palm. Visualization: 6-Donato_d'Arezzo,_Gregorio_d'Arezzo_-_Saint_Catherine_of_Alexandria_and_Twelve_Scenes_from_Her_Life_-_73.PB.69_-_J._Paul_Getty_Museum.jpg”] In the case of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, a fourth century saint from Egypt and a popular saint in early modern Europe, the date palm appears as both a symbol for her homeland as well as her status as a martyr.

Into the sixteenth and seventeenth century, as European trade networks expanded past the Mediterranean and push both westward and eastward, the date palm is an icon of the Middle East once again, but for a much broader concept of geography reduced down to the mystery of its native lands and their exciting appeal of exoticism.  Naturalists included the date palm in their botanical texts amidst the rising popularity of collecting, depicting, and describing plants. When discussing the phoenix, the authors often referenced scholars of antiquity such as Dioscorides, Strabo, and Pliny, while adding little new information to these ancient naturalists’ original commentary. Mattioli includes the plant in both editions of his Commentaries on Dioscoredes and gives the plant ample space in description and illustration. [^ref20]

Hieronymous Bock, in his 1565 Kreutterbuch, provides perhaps the most unique illustration of the date palm by placing it with a unicorn– a popular sixteenth century catch-all magical cure. Its association with the tree in an herbal context suggests the prophylactic potency of drinking the date palm’s wine from the horn of a unicorn. Visualization:]The Este family of Ferrara, Italy also paired date palms and the unicorns together in family symbolism, though half a century before Bock’s publication and likely unrelated.[^ref21]

As Europe progressed towards modernity, the date palm continued to carry its many associations into the contemporary cultural imagination: victory, prosperity, martyrdom, specific places, and elusive exoticism. The tree, usually without its fruits for which it was originally emblemized and celebrated, pops up in occasional cultural references when success must be portrayed or far off lands evoked. After winning the Battle of the Nile against Napoleon’s navy, British Lord Horatio Nelson added a palm tree to his coat of arms and adopted the motto Palmam qui meruit ferat or “let whoever earns the palm bear it,” a quote on relishing in the pride of victory through the display of a palm. [^ref22] This ancient Latin verse is also the motto for the University of California.

### Across the Atlantic
The date palm’s migration wasn’t limited to the eastern hemisphere. Today, it’s found throughout California’s Coachella valley. The first date palms in California came from Algeria, through the USDA’s Office of Seed and Plant Introduction. Established in 1898 to import new crop varieties into the hands of US farmers, this office sent agricultural explorers in search of new crops all around the world. Primary sources from these bioprospectors suggest that, rather than solely following scientific inclinations in their quest for new crops, agricultural explorers were drawn to the exotic. Take the following passage from the autobiography of David Fairchild, first head of The Office of Seed and Plant Introduction and first explorer to go after the date palm:

_It seemed unbelievable that I was sailing toward Bagdad, the city of enchantment. Would I see Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, the Sultan’s eunuchs, and beautiful, veiled ladies? It would be the voyage of adventure, for I was bound for the greatest date gardens in the world. But on this journey I was conscious of more than plants. Among the children of my generation, The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments held a place second only to Robinson Crusoe. The stories were read to us before the open fire on winter evenings, and Bagdad seemed a dream place somewhere in the dim never-never land near Crusoe’s tropical island._ [^ref23]

Fairchild’s fascination with Arabia was not abnormal; the start of the 20th century in the United States marked a period of intense cultural interest in the Middle East. Fueled by films like _The Sheik_ and _The Queen of Sheba_ (both 1921), as well as the growing investment of American oil companies in places like Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, the image of the Arabic world was, for many Americans, the site of exotic fascination and erotic pleasure. The Coachella Valley, given its climatic similarities to the Arabian Peninsula, was an appropriate site not only for date cultivation, but for cultivating a frenzy for “Arabia.” Early date growers in the Coachella Valley were quick to capitalize on this fascination, opening date gardens that borrowed from Islamic and ancient Egyptian architectural styles, establishing public festivities for the date, and renaming towns to sound Middle Eastern.

As shown in the map, the Coachella Valley has maintained some of its Middle Eastern panache. It still features a yearly date festival, and its local high school sports team still goes by the “Mighty Arabs.” [^ref25] What’s changed since Fairchild’s era is that the date palm, while it is still grown in California (between 2000 and 2020, date palm acreage increased 38% in the Coachella Valley), has come to represent something different. While the political and economic influence of the United States in the Middle East has continued to grow, its domestic attitudes have shifted— the Iranian hostage crisis and, later, September 11th, turned American opinions of the Middle East, particularly the Muslim Middle East, from a romantic to a threatening imaginary. The date itself, rather than being the fruit of an exotic new world, has found itself on the shelves of health food stores or marketed as a luxury good. [^ref26]

### The Palm Makes an Island
The date palm’s most prominent recent depiction is not an image, marketing scheme, or text; it’s an island (or, rather, three islands). In 2001, a real estate conglomerate dredged three billion cubic feet of sand from the seafloor off the coast of Dubai and used it to form an island in the shape of a date palm with 17 fronds. [^ref27] Two decades and two unfinished palm islands later, the original island, Palm Jumeirah, is now home to over 18000 people. The date palm’s use here, while differing in its grandiose scale, is not dissimilar to that in the Coachella valley; in both cases, the plant is used as a marker of luxury and cultural authenticity.

The construction of Palm Jumeirah and the decline of Dubai’s other two palm islands— both of which stand mostly abandoned—  tell us as much about the shifting economies of the Arabian Peninsula as they do about the date palm. The palm islands were devised as a method of increasing Dubai’s shoreline, as part of a larger goal of boosting tourism in order to diversify the United Arab Emirates’ economy. That the date palm was chosen as the symbol of these efforts—  not only in the palm islands but in other luxury developments like the Sheikh Zayed Mosque, pictured earlier— is not coincidental; it points to the longevity of the date palm as a meaning-making symbol. In the context of the post-OPEC Arabian Peninsula, this symbol is inextricably tied to material wealth; date palms abound in luxury items, and luxury date vendors appear in every shopping mall.

In the UAE, the date palm’s use as a marker of luxury is not without its irony. The rapid development of fossil fuel extraction in the Arabian Peninsula in the 20th century took both land and water away from date palm oases. Since then, intensive, western-style agriculture combined with droughts, likely worsened by fossil-fuel driven climatic changes, have reduced the freshwater capacity of the gulf countries by nearly 75%, [^ref28] imperiling the very desert oases that inspired the cultural works of both the ancient and the modern Islamic world. The same practices, then, that generated copious wealth that made Palm Jumeirah and the Sheikh Zayed Mosque are the practices that pose an existential threat to traditional forms of date palm cultivation in the Middle East.

### The Future of Fertility 
For more than 5,000 years, the date palm has brought good fortune to economic, religious, and cultural institutions of ancient Mesopotamia and the Middle East. However, its reputation for bringing wealth and prosperity doesn’t just benefit the aspects of our lives but also has been known to bring about an abundant number of health benefits, supporting it’s legacy as the “Elixir of Life.” In the pre-modern world, prior to understanding how valuable date palm pollen was in regards to not only its cultivation but for medicinal uses as well, the usage of dates had been a staple in Middle Eastern culture as a form of preventative medicine. Despite lacking the tools of modern medicine, date palms were known to have kept diseases at bay through their anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-tumor activities. Moreover, recent clinical studies have  shown evidence that Medjool dates are capable of improving vision (reducing night blindness), healthy bowel movements, minimizing abdominal cancer and intestinal disorders, boosting energy for anemic patients, improving nervous system health, bone health, promoting weight loss, and reducing risk of developing allergic reactions and risk of stroke as well as other health related diseases [^ref29]. This suggests that although ancient herbalists and physicians did not yet know of the mechanisms and direct advantageous effects within the body that dates provided, there was still a general understanding of how dates provided a number of holistic preventative measures towards developing severe diseases.

Even so, the reputation of the date palm as a medicine in the pre-modern world has provided a foundation for scientists and physicians of the postmodern world. It is through the contributions of ancient Middle Eastern and Mesopotamian uses of the date palm that clinical studies have been able to focus on the date palm specifically as an apparatus for improving fertility. The basis of truth regarding the Medjool date’s health benefits has allowed researchers to delve even deeper into the date palm and understand the instrumentation behind date palm pollen as the true source of medicine. “Date palm pollen (DPP) is the male reproductive dust of palm flowers used as dietary supplement especially as an aphrodisiac and fertility enhancer in both women and men from ancient times. Although there are few clinical trials evaluating the beneficial effects of DPP in humans, various experimental studies have been conducted on the reproductive effects of DPP. Among the compounds isolated from DPP are amino acids, fatty acids, flavonoids, saponins, and estroles. The present review summarizes comprehensive information concerning the phytochemistry and pharmacological activities of DPP and its application in fertility disorders.” [^ref30] 
As a natural resource for treating fertility problems in both men and women, the date palm’s characterization in the Middle East was further elevated into a heavenly object– one that transcended knowledge at the time and could only be interpreted as a gift from God. However, modern science has revealed that the phytochemical constituents, particularly the wide range of amino acids, nutritive elements, vitamins, and fatty acids present within date palm pollen, were responsible for serving as a remedy for fertility challenges. In women, date palm pollen was capable of supporting gonadotropic activity, thus enlarging female sex organs and encouraging the production of estrogen and progesterone [^ref30]. This in turn allowed women with lowered amounts of luteinizing hormones and follicle stimulating hormones, making them more susceptible to getting pregnant. Similarly, regarding male fertility, date palm pollen triggered spermatogenic activity, leading to vast improvements in sperm count and motility as well as enlarging of the testis, promoting the production of testosterone and augmenting libido [^ref30].

While the pharmacological benefits of date palm pollen require further research and clinical trials to solidify its commercial applications towards treating fertility issues in men and women, the date palm’s overall legacy as a medicinal plant has been solidified after having been utilized as a natural form of preventative medicine over thousands of years and numerous ancient cultures in ancient Mesopotamia and the Middle East. Even so, the story of _Phoenix dactylifera_ continues to evolve and grow with the times, as it becomes further embedded into the cultural, economic and scientific institutions of the Western world.
