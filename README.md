### Introduction
Parts of the Sheikh Zayed Mosque, completed in Abu Dhabi in 2007, look a lot like the pyramid of Sahure, completed in lower Egypt in the 25th century BC. While they’re separated by 45 centuries, thousands of miles, and differing cosmologies, date palms feature as prominently in ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian imagery as they do in peninsular Arabic cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The historical longevity of the date palm (_Phoenix dactylifera_) as a symbol is a testament not only to the species’ continued horticultural use, but to its adaptability as a vessel for cultural-identity making—  since the earliest societies in Mesopotamia, the date palm has appeared in literary, pictorial, political, and religious documentation. Like its namesake the phoenix, the date palm has, throughout recorded history, made and remade itself— sometimes a symbol for life and fertility, other times a symbol for victory, wealth, and prosperity. While the recorded uses of the Phoenix dactylifera are many, ranging from the date’s value as a durable and nutrient rich foodstuff to the palm frond’s uses in construction and Christian ritual to the potential fertility enhancing components of date palm pollen, the date palm itself is more than a useful plant; it is a collection of symbols that traverse human history.

### The Roots of the Date Palm 
Insert paragraph here

### Date Palm Oases
The date palm was first cultivated in oases, groundwater-fed areas of settlement and agriculture within arid environments. In Northern Africa and the Arabian peninsula, oases served as both rest stops along desert journeys and as sites of agroforestry. As seen in the figure, traditional oases feature a multi-tiered system of plant cultivation, in which date palms form a canopy that shields smaller fruit trees, like apricots, figs, and olives, from direct sunlight. These smaller trees in turn shield the oasis floor, where vegetables are grown and animals are raised. The date palms, through their wind reduction, increased shade, and evapotranspiration, help form a microclimate conducive to prolific plant cultivation in an extreme environment. [^ref1]

## Across the Atlantic
The date palm’s migration wasn’t limited to the eastern hemisphere. Today, it’s found throughout California’s Coachella valley. The first date palms in California came from Algeria, through the USDA’s Office of Seed and Plant Introduction. Established in 1898 to import new crop varieties into the hands of US farmers, this office sent agricultural explorers in search of new crops all around the world. Primary sources from these bioprospectors suggest that, rather than solely following scientific inclinations in their quest for new crops, agricultural explorers were drawn to the exotic. Take the following passage from the autobiography of David Fairchild, first head of The Office of Seed and Plant Introduction and first explorer to go after the date palm:

_It seemed unbelievable that I was sailing toward Bagdad, the city of enchantment. Would I see Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, the Sultan’s eunuchs, and beautiful, veiled ladies? It would be the voyage of adventure, for I was bound for the greatest date gardens in the world. But on this journey I was conscious of more than plants. Among the children of my generation, The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments held a place second only to Robinson Crusoe. The stories were read to us before the open fire on winter evenings, and Bagdad seemed a dream place somewhere in the dim never-never land near Crusoe’s tropical island._ *FN Here*

Fairchild’s fascination with Arabia was not abnormal; the start of the 20th century in the United States marked a period of intense cultural interest in the Middle East. Fueled by films like _The Sheik_ and _The Queen of Sheba_ (both 1921), as well as the growing investment of American oil companies in places like Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, the image of the Arabic world was, for many Americans, the site of exotic fascination and erotic pleasure. The Coachella Valley, given its climatic similarities to the Arabian Peninsula, was an appropriate site not only for date cultivation, but for cultivating a frenzy for “Arabia.” Early date growers in the Coachella Valley were quick to capitalize on this fascination, opening date gardens that borrowed from Islamic and ancient Egyptian architectural styles, establishing public festivities for the date, and renaming towns to sound Middle Eastern.

As shown in the map, the Coachella Valley has maintained some of its Middle Eastern panache. It still features a yearly date festival, and its local high school sports team still goes by the “Mighty Arabs.” FOOTNOTE HERE What’s changed since Fairchild’s era is that the date palm, while it is still grown in California (between 2000 and 2020, date palm acreage increased 38% in the Coachella Valley), has come to represent something different. While the political and economic influence of the United States in the Middle East has continued to grow, its domestic attitudes have shifted— the Iranian hostage crisis and, later, September 11th, turned American opinions of the Middle East, particularly the Muslim Middle East, from a romantic to a threatening imaginary. The date itself, rather than being the fruit of an exotic new world, has found itself on the shelves of health food stores or marketed as a luxury good. FOOTNOTE HERE also MAP goes with this

### The Palm Makes an Island
The date palm’s most prominent recent depiction is not an image, marketing scheme, or text; it’s an island (or, rather, three islands). In 2001, a real estate conglomerate dredged three billion cubic feet of sand from the seafloor off the coast of Dubai and used it to form an island in the shape of a date palm with 17 fronds. FOOTNOTE HERE Two decades and two unfinished palm islands later, the original island, Palm Jumeirah, is now home to over 18000 people. The date palm’s use here, while differing in its grandiose scale, is not dissimilar to that in the Coachella valley; in both cases, the plant is used as a marker of luxury and cultural authenticity.

The construction of Palm Jumeirah and the decline of Dubai’s other two palm islands— both of which stand mostly abandoned—  tell us as much about the shifting economies of the Arabian Peninsula as they do about the date palm. The palm islands were devised as a method of increasing Dubai’s shoreline, as part of a larger goal of boosting tourism in order to diversify the United Arab Emirates’ economy. That the date palm was chosen as the symbol of these efforts—  not only in the palm islands but in other luxury developments like the Sheikh Zayed Mosque, pictured earlier— is not coincidental; it points to the longevity of the date palm as a meaning-making symbol. In the context of the post-OPEC Arabian Peninsula, this symbol is inextricably tied to material wealth; date palms abound in luxury items, and luxury date vendors appear in every shopping mall.

In the UAE, the date palm’s use as a marker of luxury is not without its irony. The rapid development of fossil fuel extraction in the Arabian Peninsula in the 20th century took both land and water away from date palm oases. Since then, intensive, western-style agriculture combined with droughts, likely worsened by fossil-fuel driven climatic changes, have reduced the freshwater capacity of the gulf countries by nearly 75%, FOOTNOTE HERE imperiling the very desert oases that inspired the cultural works of both the ancient and the modern Islamic world. The same practices, then, that generated copious wealth that made Palm Jumeirah and the Sheikh Zayed Mosque are the practices that pose an existential threat to traditional forms of date palm cultivation in the Middle East.
