### Introduction
Parts of the Sheikh Zayed Mosque, completed in Abu Dhabi in 2007, look a lot like the pyramid of Sahure, completed in lower Egypt in the 25th century BC. While they’re separated by 45 centuries, thousands of miles, and differing cosmologies, date palms feature as prominently in ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian imagery as they do in peninsular Arabic cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The historical longevity of the date palm as a symbol is a testament not only to the species’ continued horticultural use, but to its adaptability as a vessel for meaning-making/cultural-identity making.
