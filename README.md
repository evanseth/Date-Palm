### Introduction
Parts of the Sheikh Zayed Mosque, completed in Abu Dhabi in 2007, look a lot like the pyramid of Sahure, completed in lower Egypt in the 25th century BC. While they’re separated by 45 centuries, thousands of miles, and differing cosmologies, date palms feature as prominently in ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian imagery as they do in peninsular Arabic cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The historical longevity of the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) as a symbol is a testament not only to the species’ continued horticultural use, but to its adaptability as a vessel for cultural-identity making—  since the earliest societies in Mesopotamia, the date palm has appeared in literary, pictorial, political, and religious documentation. Like its namesake the phoenix, the date palm has, throughout recorded history, made and remade itself— sometimes a symbol for life and fertility, other times a symbol for victory, wealth, and prosperity. While the recorded uses of the Phoenix dactylifera are many, ranging from the date’s value as a durable and nutrient rich foodstuff to the palm frond’s uses in construction and Christian ritual to the potential fertility enhancing components of date palm pollen, the date palm itself is more than a useful plant; it is a collection of symbols that traverse human history.

### The Roots of the Date Palm 
Insert paragraph here

### Date Palm Oases
The date palm was first cultivated in oases, groundwater-fed areas of settlement and agriculture within arid environments. In Northern Africa and the Arabian peninsula, oases served as both rest stops along desert journeys and as sites of agroforestry. As seen in the figure, traditional oases feature a multi-tiered system of plant cultivation, in which date palms form a canopy that shields smaller fruit trees, like apricots, figs, and olives, from direct sunlight. These smaller trees in turn shield the oasis floor, where vegetables are grown and animals are raised. The date palms, through their wind reduction, increased shade, and evapotranspiration, help form a microclimate conducive to prolific plant cultivation in an extreme environment. [^ref1]

## Across the Atlantic
The date palm’s migration wasn’t limited to the eastern hemisphere. Today, it’s found throughout California’s Coachella valley. The first date palms in California came from Algeria, through the USDA’s Office of Seed and Plant Introduction. Established in 1898 to import new crop varieties into the hands of US farmers, this office sent agricultural explorers in search of new crops all around the world. Primary sources from these bioprospectors suggest that, rather than solely following scientific inclinations in their quest for new crops, agricultural explorers were drawn to the exotic. Take the following passage from the autobiography of David Fairchild, first head of The Office of Seed and Plant Introduction and first explorer to go after the date palm: 

_It seemed unbelievable that I was sailing toward Bagdad, the city of enchantment. Would I see Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, the Sultan’s eunuchs, and beautiful, veiled ladies? It would be the voyage of adventure, for I was bound for the greatest date gardens in the world. But on this journey I was conscious of more than plants. Among the children of my generation, The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments held a place second only to Robinson Crusoe. The stories were read to us before the open fire on winter evenings, and Bagdad seemed a dream place somewhere in the dim never-never land near Crusoe’s tropical island._
